# Challenges and Solutions

## 1. 3D Object Detection
- **Challenge:** YOLO excels at 2D; spatial reasoning for real 3D tasks is limited.
- **Solution:** Pair YOLO with stereo/Depth sensors, or leverage YOLO-3D/PointPillars/MV3D.

## 2. Onboard Computation
- **Challenge:** Real-time models demand hardware beyond standard embedded boards.
- **Solution:** Use lightweight architectures (YOLO Nano, MobileNet-SSD, TensorFlow Lite), edge AI, or hybrid with ground station.

## 3. Control and PID
- **Challenge:** PID is sensitive to non-linear system behavior and sensor noise.
- **Solution:** Employ cascaded/adaptive PID, integrate sensor fusion (Kalman filter), or use predictive controls.

## 4. Real-Time Communication
- **Challenge:** Latency degrades closed-loop control if all perception is offboarded.
- **Solution:** Keep low-level stabilization onboard, offload only high-level decisions, use low-latency links (5G/Wi-Fi 6), compress and prioritize data.

## 5. Environmental Robustness
- **Challenge:** Performance drops in poor lighting, dynamic scenery, or occlusion.
- **Solution:** Broaden training with domain-specific images, redundant sensors for fail-safe fallback.

## 6. Power/Weight Constraints
- **Challenge:** More hardware increases drone mass and reduces endurance.
- **Solution:** Model quantization, edge accelerators (FPGA/ASIC), strict selection of essential sensors.

## 7. Security and Link Reliability
- **Challenge:** Wireless links are vulnerable to loss/interference and security attacks.
- **Solution:** Use redundant radio, encrypt all traffic (AES-256), adoption of authentication protocols, fallback onboard models.

## 8. Scalability
- **Challenge:** Single ground station cannot scale for multi-drone swarms.
- **Solution:** Distributed edge/cloud processing (Kubernetes), lightweight local inference, prioritize fail-safe return-to-home.
