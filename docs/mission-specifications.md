# Mission Specifications

## Overview
The project aims to realize a fully autonomous drone for 3D object recognition, target detection, and precise landing without ground team intervention. Mission success relies on robust perception, real-time decision making, and accurate control.

## Mission Tasks
- Detect and localize 3D objects and designated targets in varied environments using advanced computer vision (YOLOv8).
- Align autonomously to the detected spot and attempt to land with minimal error.
- Operate in mixed indoor/outdoor zones with lighting, occlusion, and dynamic background challenges.
- Communicate seamlessly with the ground station for path planning and monitoring.
- Guarantee system failsafes and emergency recovery during communication loss or abnormal flight states.

## Key Performance Metrics
- Detection and localization accuracy for multiple object classes.
- Alignment precision (measured by offset from target center).
- End-to-end mission latency: Perception to action loop < 100ms.
- Robustness to adverse lighting and environmental variability.
